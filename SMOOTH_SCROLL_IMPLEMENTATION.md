# 🚀 Smooth Scroll Implementation with Lenis

## Overview

Implemented **Lenis** - the modern industry-standard smooth scrolling library used by major companies like DeSo, Superpower, and Daylight Computer.

## ✨ What is Lenis?

Lenis (Latin for "smooth") is a lightweight, robust, and performant smooth scroll library designed specifically for:

- Modern React/Next.js applications
- WebGL scroll syncing
- Parallax effects
- Professional smooth scrolling experiences

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Ultra-Smooth Scrolling**

- Smooth mouse wheel scrolling with customizable easing
- Enhanced trackpad support (two-finger scrolling)
- Natural momentum and deceleration
- 60fps performance (capped by browser on Safari)

### 2. **Custom Configuration**

```typescript
{
  duration: 1.2,                    // Animation duration (seconds)
  easing: (t) => Math.min(1, 1.001 - Math.pow(2, -10 * t)), // Custom easing
  orientation: "vertical",           // Scroll direction
  gestureOrientation: "vertical",    // Gesture direction
  smoothWheel: true,                 // Smooth wheel events
  wheelMultiplier: 1,                // Wheel sensitivity
  smoothTouch: false,                // Touch device handling
  touchMultiplier: 2,                // Touch sensitivity
  infinite: false,                   // No infinite scroll
  autoResize: true,                  // Auto resize on window change
}
```

### 3. **Integrated with Existing Features**

- ✅ Works with Framer Motion animations
- ✅ Compatible with TextPullUp word animations
- ✅ Maintains scroll detection for StickyNav
- ✅ Enhanced "Scroll to Discover" button behavior

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### New Files:

1. **`app/components/SmoothScrolling.tsx`**
   - Wrapper component that initializes Lenis
   - Handles RAF (Request Animation Frame) loop
   - Auto-cleanup on unmount

### Modified Files:

1. **`app/layout.tsx`**

   - Added Lenis CSS import
   - Wrapped children with SmoothScrolling component

2. **`app/components/Hero.tsx`**

   - Updated scroll-to-portfolio logic to use window.scrollTo
   - Maintains smooth transition with Lenis

3. **`app/components/StickyNav.tsx`**
   - Updated navigation scroll logic
   - Now uses window.scrollTo for Lenis compatibility

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before:

- Basic browser scroll behavior
- Jerky wheel scrolling on some devices
- Inconsistent trackpad behavior
- Instant section jumps

### After:

- ✨ Buttery smooth scrolling with natural momentum
- 🎯 Consistent behavior across all input methods
- 🌊 Smooth easing and deceleration
- 💫 Professional feel matching modern portfolio sites

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works:

1. **Initialization**: Lenis is initialized once in the SmoothScrolling component
2. **RAF Loop**: Continuous animation frame loop updates scroll position
3. **Event Handling**: Intercepts native scroll events and applies smooth interpolation
4. **Cleanup**: Properly destroys instance on component unmount

### Performance:

- Lightweight (~10KB minified)
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Optimized for 60fps
- No jank or stuttering

## 🌐 Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest) - capped at 60fps
- ✅ Edge (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## 🚨 Known Limitations

- No CSS scroll-snap support (would need lenis/snap plugin)
- Capped at 60fps on Safari (browser limitation)
- 30fps on low power mode
- Smooth scroll stops over iframes
