## Testing Instructions

### Visual Tests:

1. **Toggle Views:**

   - Click grid view button (left icon)
   - Watch for smooth fade transition
   - Click list view button (right icon)
   - Verify smooth return transition

2. **Grid Cards:**

   - All cards should be same size (4:3 ratio)
   - Text should be readable
   - Hover over any card → see green glow background
   - Hover over duration badge → see tooltip with months

3. **Animations:**

   - Switch to grid → cards appear in sequence (left to right)
   - Stagger effect should feel smooth, not choppy
   - View transitions should not feel jarring

4. **Responsive:**
   - Desktop (1024px+): 3 columns
   - Tablet (768px-1023px): 2 columns
   - Mobile (<768px): Uses MobileWorkExperiences component

### Interaction Tests:

- [ ] Click company logo → opens LinkedIn
- [ ] Click company name → opens company website
- [ ] Click location → opens Google Maps
- [ ] Hover duration badge → tooltip appears
- [ ] Move mouse away → tooltip disappears
- [ ] Tab through elements → proper focus order

## Files Modified

1. **WorkExperienceGrid.tsx**

   - Added TooltipProvider import
   - Added aspect-ratio style to card wrapper
   - Added stagger animation (delay: idx \* 0.1)
   - Wrapped duration badge with Tooltip
   - Reduced text sizes across all elements
   - Adjusted card padding (p-6)
   - Changed card layout to flex with justify-between

2. **Work.tsx**
   - Added AnimatePresence import
   - Wrapped list view in motion.div with animations
   - Wrapped grid view in motion.div with animations
   - Added mode="wait" to AnimatePresence
   - Added unique keys ("list-view", "grid-view")

## Performance Notes

- **Animation Impact:** Negligible (~600ms total)
- **GPU Accelerated:** Opacity and transform animations
- **Memory Efficient:** TooltipProvider shared across grid
- **Render Optimization:** Only one view rendered at a time

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge 88+
- ✅ Firefox 87+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ⚠️ IE: Not supported (aspect-ratio fallback needed)

## What You'll See

### Before vs After:

**Before:**

- Cards various heights
- Duration badge showed "1y 1m"
- Larger text (harder to scan)
- Instant view switching
- All cards appear at once

**After:**

- All cards same size (4:3)
- Duration badge shows "Nov 2024-present" + tooltip
- Optimized text sizes
- Smooth animated transitions
- Cards cascade in with stagger

## Next Steps

1. **Test in your dev server:**

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Work section**

3. **Test all features:**

   - Toggle between views
   - Hover tooltips
   - Check card sizes
   - Watch animations

4. **Provide feedback:**
   - Do animations feel smooth?
   - Are text sizes comfortable?
   - Does 4:3 ratio look good?
   - Any issues with tooltips?

## Potential Tweaks (If Needed)

### Animation Speed:

```tsx
// In Work.tsx - adjust duration
transition={{ duration: 0.5 }} // Slower
transition={{ duration: 0.2 }} // Faster
```

### Card Size:

```tsx
// In WorkExperienceGrid.tsx - adjust ratio
style={{ aspectRatio: "3 / 2" }} // Wider
style={{ aspectRatio: "1 / 1" }} // Square
```

### Text Sizes:

```tsx
// In WorkExperienceGrid.tsx - adjust classes
className = "text-base"; // Larger
className = "text-xs"; // Smaller
```

### Stagger Speed:

```tsx
// In WorkExperienceGrid.tsx - adjust delay
delay: idx * 0.15; // Slower cascade
delay: idx * 0.05; // Faster cascade
```
